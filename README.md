## âœ‹ Introducing `ggGit`

`ggGit` is a fast Git command line tool with full support for Conventional Commits. Contains a set of commands to help you to work with Git in a more efficient way and easy to understand.

Internally, `ggGit` uses the `git` command to execute the operations.


## Installation

The installation process is simple and fast. You need to clone the repository and add the Bash or PowerShell scripts path to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Install in Linux Systems

> [!NOTE]
> The installation process is the same for Bash emulation in Windows.

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/novafuria/ggGit
```

Add the path to the `PATH` environment variable in the `.bashrc` file

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/ggGit/bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `zsh`, you need to add the path to the `PATH` environment variable in the `.zshrc` file.

Reload the `.bashrc` file

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check the installation

```bash
