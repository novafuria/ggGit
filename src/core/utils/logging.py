"""
Logging module for ggGit.

This module provides centralized logging functionality
for debugging and troubleshooting.

The LoggingManager class provides a unified logging interface that
handles both file and console logging with configurable levels.
It creates structured log files in the user's .gggit directory and
provides specialized logging methods for different types of events.

Log files are organized by date and include detailed context information
to aid in debugging and monitoring command execution.
